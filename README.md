# ZupCryptoWatcher
Very simple Android MVVM project using Jetpack, Retrofit, RxJava and Koin.

This project uses the CoinMarketCap API.
If you want to run the project, you need to generate an API Key inside https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

After that, just edit your `local.properties` file adding:

`API_KEY_DEVELOPMENT="<YOUR-SANDBOX-API-KEY>"`

`API_KEY_PRODUCTION="<YOUR-PRODUCTION-API-KEY>"`
